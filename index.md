## Welcome to Dependency Checker Pages

Many time we face the situation where we would like to know about the list of dependency files and it's installers.
Though it's easy to find the dependencies of an executables (which is already installed) but it's very tedious job 
to find their installers. This script actually does that job. You just need to run this script with the application \name as it's argument and it'll list down all the installers which are required 

### Usage

```
./depchecker <application name>
./depchecker apache2

```

### Limitations

This script has following limitations

- Runs only on Debian
- Usage section needs more contribution
